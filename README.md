** HACK **

This program was written to educational goal. It is a ELF file, containing two mistakes. One of them, a very "popular" buffer
overflow. About the second, I canâ€™t say anything until my cracker partner hacks me. But after this I will update and add the description 
of this "bug" (it is not exactly bug, it something special for my cracker partner) too.
